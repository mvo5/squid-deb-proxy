# network destinations that are allowed by this cache

# the default mirror names on debian are ftp[0-9]*\.[a-z]+\.debian\.org
# but that would require (slow) regexp matching, so for now we allow
# www.debian.org and friends here too
.debian.org 
cdn.debian.net
http.debian.net

# default mirrors
#ftp.debian.org 
#security.debian.org

# additional destinations can be added to the directory:
